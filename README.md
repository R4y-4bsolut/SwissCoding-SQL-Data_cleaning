# Data Cleaning with SQL  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **cleaning and preparing data** using SQL. We will work with a dataset containing club member information and transform it into a cleaner, more usable format.  

### Dataset  
- The original data is stored in a CSV file: **club_member_info.csv**.  
- It may contain issues like missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and errors.  

### Goals  
1. **Import** the dataset into a database.  
2. **Identify and fix** common data issues.  
3. **Apply SQL queries** to clean and standardize the data.  
4. **Prepare** the final dataset for analysis.
